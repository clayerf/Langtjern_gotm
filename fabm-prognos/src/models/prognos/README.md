## PROGNOS - PREDICTING IN-LAKE RESPONSES TO CHANGE USING NEAR REAL TIME MODELS

[PROGNOS](http://prognoswater.org/) is a project funded bu [Water JPI](http://www.waterjpi.eu/) ....
The PROGNOS project (PREDICTING IN-LAKE RESPONSES TO CHANGE USING NEAR REAL TIME MODELS) is working to develop short-term water quality 
forecasts by coupling high frequency lake monitoring data and future weather forecast data to lake hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models 
using the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Modelling (FABM).  This integrated approach that couples HF data to dynamic models to 
forecast short-term changes in lake state, will inform management decisions to help safeguard the ecosystem services that lakes provide.  
PROGNOS is funded by the EU and national funding agencies of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Ireland and Israel under the ERA-NET WaterWorks2014
