## PROGNOS - DOM

Model of DOM processing in freshwater part of the PROGNOS/DOM model. 
The pools (boxes), reactions (arrows) rate formulations (numbers) are described 
in Tables Pools, Rxn and Rates, respectively. 

ERGOM refers to the existing ERGOM module (http://www.ergom.net/)
and MIXO refer to an upcoming mixotroph phytoplankton update. 

**Table Pools**. Pools of carbon considered as well as their source and sinks in the model. Pools, sources and sinks in parentheses are already in FABM 

| Pool | Symbol | Source | Sink |
| -------- | -------- |  -------- |  -------- | 
|  (Labile POC)1 |  	(POMa)	  | (Primary production)  |  	(Sinking)  |
|  (Semi-labile POM)2 |  	(POMb)  |	Flocculation, River inflow   |   Sinking |
